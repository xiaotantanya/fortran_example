@subsection material_overview Overview

Setting the material's properties is an necessary part of any \f$\mu\f$-ProÂ® module. 
Any input value related to material phases and property tensors are configured through the material's input explained in the next few pages.
For beginners knowing how to use the GUI interface to guide you create the material properties' input is enough, but for power users, 
you may want to learn how the material properties part of the *input.xml* file is structured.

There are three levels of elements, 
- **@subpage material_material "material"** The parent tag of all material phases and properties. The material can have multiple phases.
    - **@subpage material_phase "phase"** Set the properties of one phase. Each phase can have multiple tensors.
        - **@subpage material_tensor "tensor"** Set one property tensor. Each tensor may contain several components.
            - **@subpage material_component "component"** Set the value for one component of a tensor.


@subsection material_material Material            
Material is usually a child element of the system element, which allows you to set the values of various property tensors of each phases. 
In most cases there can only exist one material element.

Intuitively, the whole system is considered as one material. In most of our calculations, the material is a composite of multiple phases.

# Element structure
- **material**
    - **format** Specify the source of material/phase information for calculation. For now, the only available option is *xml*, that is the *input.xml* file. 
    - **phase** Set values for phases. You can set multiple phase elements under material.

# Example
<br>
@code{.XML}
<material>
    <format>xml</format>
    <phase>
        <label>0</label>
        <tensor>
            <pointGroup>cubic</pointGroup>
            <name>permittivity</name>
            <rank>2</rank>
            <component>
                <value>3.5</value>
                <index>11</index>
            </component>
        </tensor>
    </phase>
    <phase>
        <label>1</label>
        <tensor>
            <pointGroup>cubic</pointGroup>
            <name>permittivity</name>
            <rank>2</rank>
            <component>
                <value>100</value>
                <index>11</index>
            </component>
        </tensor>
    </phase>
</material>

@subsection material_phase Phase

Phase is the child element of the *material* element. There can exist multiple *phase* elements, and each *phase* element can have multiple *tensor* elements. 
Each phase element must also has a *label* element as child, which is used to link with the label you specify in the structure generator 
so that the program knows which material property should assigned to each simulation grid point.

Besides from the normal phase defined in material, there is a special type of phase called "ref" defined in the "solver" element, which is used to set the homogeneous value
needed by our solver. The syntax is the same as a normal phase element, except it does not have a label child.

# Element structure
- **phase**
    - **label** The phase label. This is the same value you used in structure generator.
    - **tensor** The property tensors of current phase.

# Example
<br>
@code{.XML}
<phase>
    <label>0</label>
    <tensor>
        <pointGroup>cubic</pointGroup>
        <name>permittivity</name>
        <rank>2</rank>
        <component>
            <value>3.5</value>
            <index>11</index>
        </component>
    </tensor>
</phase>
